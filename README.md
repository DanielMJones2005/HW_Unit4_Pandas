#You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
- 1. Males make up the majority of players at 84.03%, out of 576 total unique players
    - a.	Females make up the second largest group of unique players at 14.06%, and Other/Non-Disclosed are 1.91% of total unique players
    - b.	Males are the core market demographic
- 2. While Males make up the majority of unique players, the average total purchase per person is actually greatest for Other/Non-Disclosed at $4.56 compared to Males, who spent an average $4.56 total purchase per person, followed by Females who spent an average $4.47 total purchase per person
    - a.	This would suggest increased marketing to Other/Non-Disclosed and Females could increase revenue
- 3. While the largest age demographic of unique players was the 20-24 age group at 44.79% of the total 576 unique players,
    - a.	The largest average total purchase per person came from the 35-39 age group, which had an average total purchase per person of $4.76
    - b.	The 20-24 age group actually ranked 3rd for average total purchase per person with $4.32 average total purchase per person
          - i.	The <10 age group was second with an average total purchase per person of $4.50
              - 1.	Although based on reason/logic, the <10 age group most likely does not have a revenue stream, and much less disposable income,
              - 2.	These purchases are most likely coming from individuals/parents with disposable income
